Ludo Dice Probability Simulator

Description
This project simulates rolling two six-sided dice one million times and displays the probability distribution of their sums (2–12). It helps compare real simulated results to theoretical probabilities.

The Concepts that are used

-C Programming: for loop,arrays,functions,rand(), printf().

-Mathematics concepts: Probabilty Distribution, Data Analysis,Stochastic Modelling.
